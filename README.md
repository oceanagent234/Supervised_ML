Overview
This project aims to predict student exam scores based on the number of hours they study. By utilizing a supervised machine learning approach, specifically linear regression, the model identifies the relationship between study hours and scores. The resulting model can be used to make predictions and provide insights into how study habits may influence academic performance.
